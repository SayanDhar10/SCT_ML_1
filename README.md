# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Using Linear Regression

This machine learning project leverages **enhanced linear regression methods** to accurately forecast residential home values. Built on the popular **Kaggle House Prices** dataset, the system delivers reliable predictions by examining three key property features:

* **Above-ground living space (in square feet)**
* **Total number of bedrooms**
* **Total number of full bathrooms**

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project implements advanced linear regression techniques to predict house prices based on three key features:

- `GrLivArea` (Square Footage)
- `BedroomAbvGr` (Number of Bedrooms)
- `FullBath` (Number of Bathrooms)

Using the **Kaggle House Prices dataset**, we compare multiple regression approaches and provide an **interactive prediction interface** for easy use.
